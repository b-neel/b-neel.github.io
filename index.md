Is an air bubble, say, standing at the surface of a water glass doomed to burst, as we may experience it everyday? 
If yes, how long does it take to do so? And what if there are now many bubbles at the surface? Or salt, or surface contaminant?
We do know that when a single bubble pops, it sends small liquid drops in the atmosphere. 
But... how high? How little? How many? What about solid, mineral components? Volatile, olfactive molecules? And what are the consequences, just when applied to ocean and cloud formation?

With a physicistâ€™s background, an endless curiosity about the world around, as well as strong experimental skills, I question those objects, their behaviors, interactions and consequences in our everyday lives.
Bubbles. Drops. And also Clouds. Grains. Sand.
As a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [Deike Lab](https://ldeike.princeton.edu), I presently work on the production of sea spray aerosols, with an experimental focus on collective effects in the bursting of surface bubbles.
