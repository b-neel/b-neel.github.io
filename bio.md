I was trained as a physicist at the *École Normale Supérieure* in Paris, with a specialization in hydrodynamics, complex systems and non-linear physics.
As parts of the curriculum, I did two experimental internships under the mentoring of:

* **Nicolás Mujica** in the *Laboratorio de Materia Fuera de Equilibrio* (LMFE, Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile), where I worked on a vibrated monolayer of grains.
* **Henri Lhuissier** and **Laurent Limat** in the lab *Matière et Systèmes Complexes* (MSC, Université Paris Diderot, Paris), studying the impact and deflection of a visco-elastic jet on a pillar. 

Each time, I set up the experiment and implemented the data processing, and both of them led to a [publication](../publications) (Phys. Rev. E and Phys. Rev. Lett. respectively).

I completed my PhD under the supervision of **Emmanuel Villermaux** at the *Institut de Recherche sur les Phénomènes Hors Équilibre* (IRPHE, Marseille).
There, I worked on the destabilisation and rupture of free standing liquid films, contributing to the fields of liquid fragmentation and stability of interfaces.

My training does not end here, since as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in **Luc Deike**'s group at Princeton University, I am extending my field of expertise to oceanographic and atmospheric sciences.
